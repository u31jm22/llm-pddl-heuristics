# LLM Generated Heuristics for PDDL Planning

## Overview

Final year dissertation project exploring the use of large language models to generate domain specific heuristics within a classical PDDL based planning framework.

## Focus

- Python implementation of heuristic search
- Greedy best first search
- LLM based heuristic generation
- Structured experimental benchmarking
- CSV based result logging and analysis

## Current Status

Project in active development. Experimental runs and evaluation ongoing.
